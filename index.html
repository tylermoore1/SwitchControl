			<ul>
				<li>So for this project, I implemented a two button and four button switch control
						to see which one was quicker and more efficient. I used the basic 'w,a,s,d' keys
						when I did the four button switch control. This allowed the program to move up, down,
						left and right to whatever button the user needed. Then when I did the two button control,
						I used the 'a and d' keys so the user can go left and right throughout the layout. Finally,
						I used the 'k' key to click enter on the button the user wanted to use. </li> <br />
				<li>After doing 5 different equations with both the two button and four button switch control,
						I found out the four button is more efficient. In every equation, the four button came out
						quicker. Here were the five equations I used:
							<ul>
								<li> 5 * 4 + 12 </li>
								<li> 2 + 3 + 92 - 53 + 6 </li>
								<li> 21 / 3 + 7 - 4 * 5 </li>
								<li> 3 - 3 + 4 * 15 - 10 </li>
								<li> 100 / 10 / 5 + 4 * 2 </li>
							</ul>
					The average input for the four button switch control was: 14.842 seconds, while the two button was:
					20.864 seconds. So there was a 6 secong gap between the two styles. </li> <br />
				<li>I also played around with a 6 button switch control to see how it would work and it got
						very confusing for me. I included two more buttons to bring me to the top or bottom of the
						page. I'm sure if I got more practice it would work better, but it was just too many buttons
					 	for me to use effectively. </li>
